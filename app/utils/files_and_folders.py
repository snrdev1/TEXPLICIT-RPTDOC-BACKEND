    # The code snippet f"./outputs/{hashlib.sha1(question.encode()).hexdigest()}" is constructing a file path based on a hashed version of a 'question' string using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

    # - 'question' is a string that you want to hash. It could be any string, such as a question or some other data.
    # - 'question.encode()' converts the 'question' string into bytes. Hash functions typically operate on bytes, so this step is necessary to convert the string into a format that the hash function can process.
    # - 'hashlib.sha1(question.encode())' creates a SHA-1 hash object. The hashlib module in Python provides various hash functions, and in this case, it's using SHA-1.
    # - '.hexdigest()' is called on the SHA-1 hash object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash. In other words, it converts the binary hash value into a human-readable hexadecimal string.
    # - 'f"./outputs/{hashlib.sha1(question.encode()).hexdigest()}"' uses an f-string to construct a file path. It places the hexadecimal representation of the SHA-1 hash at the end of the path, making it unique to the input 'question'.

    # So, this code generates a file path that is based on the SHA-1 hash of the 'question' string, which can be useful for creating unique filenames or directories associated with the input data.
