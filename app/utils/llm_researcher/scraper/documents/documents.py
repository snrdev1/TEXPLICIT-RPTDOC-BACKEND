    """
    The function `retrieve_context_from_documents` retrieves relevant documents based on a user query,
    filters them based on a score threshold, and constructs a context by formatting the extracted
    document excerpts.
    
    Args:
      user_id: The user_id is a unique identifier for the user. It is used to retrieve the document
    vectorstore and original files associated with the user.
      query (str): The query is the text that you want to search for in the documents. It can be a
    single word, a phrase, or a sentence.
      max_docs (int): The `max_docs` parameter specifies the maximum number of documents to retrieve as
    part of the context. By default, it is set to 15. Defaults to 15
      score_threshold (float): The `score_threshold` parameter is a threshold value used to filter the
    relevant documents based on their scores. Any document with a score higher than the
    `score_threshold` will be excluded from the final list of relevant documents.
    
    Returns:
      The function `retrieve_context_from_documents` returns the context, which is a string containing
    the formatted excerpts from relevant documents.
